print("Why RANSAC Performs Better:")
print("1. OLS minimizes sum of squared residuals: min Σ(y_i - (ax_i + b))²")
print("   - Outliers create large residuals that disproportionately influence the solution")
print("2. RANSAC uses a voting mechanism:")
print("   a) Randomly select minimal samples (2 for linear regression)")
print("   b) Fit model to these samples")
print("   c) Identify inliers within residual threshold")
print("   d) Repeat, keeping model with most inliers")
print("   e) Final model is fit on all identified inliers")
print("   - Outliers are excluded from final model fitting")
